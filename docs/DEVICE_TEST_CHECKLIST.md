# Physical Apple TV verification checklist

Only checks run on a real Apple TV count as verification of iCloud loading. Automated tests use a fake image provider, and the simulator has no iCloud Photos library.

Record each result as ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ with notes, and keep the filled-in copy in the repo.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | |
| Apple TV model and storage | (e.g. Apple TV 4K 3rd gen, 32 GB) |
| tvOS version | |
| Stillroom version (build) | (About screen) |
| Network | (Wi‑Fi / Ethernet, approximate speed) |
| Library size and iCloud Photos setting on the Apple TV | |
| Test album name, photo count in Photos, number of videos | |

## 0. Setup

- [ ] **0.1** Apple TV: Settings › Users and Accounts › *you* › iCloud › **iCloud Photos is on**. Note how long ago it was turned on.
- [ ] **0.2** Apple TV storage: Settings › General › Storage (or equivalent). Note the free space before testing: ______
- [ ] **0.3** Install Stillroom from Xcode (see README). On the Mac, open Console.app, select the Apple TV, filter on `subsystem:com.friedrichsenweb.Stillroom`, and start streaming.
- [ ] **0.4** Pick a **large test album** (ideally several hundred photos) that includes photos you haven't viewed on the Apple TV recently, so they're likely to be cloud-only. Note its photo count as shown in Photos on iPhone or Mac, and how many of its items are videos.

## 1. Permissions and states

- [ ] **1.1** First launch shows the explanation screen **with no system prompt on top of it**. **Continue** shows the system prompt, and its text matches the app's usage description.
- [ ] **1.2** Choose **Allow access to all Photos**, not "Select" (limited access), and the album grid appears. Optional: on a reinstall, try "Select" and confirm the header says "Limited access."
- [ ] **1.3** Deny path: delete and reinstall the app, deny access, and confirm the "Photos Access Is Off" screen. Follow its Settings path. **Is the path shown correct on this tvOS version?** Actual path: ______
- [ ] **1.4** Re-enable access in Settings, return to the app, and confirm the grid appears without relaunching.

## 2. Albums and counts

- [ ] **2.1** Every ordinary album you expect is listed, including albums inside folders. Shared Albums are not listed.
- [ ] **2.1a** Folders from Photos appear as folder cards, and folders and albums are in the same order as My Albums in Photos (rearrange a few in Photos first to test). *Order matched Photos on 2026‑09‑24, Apple TV HD, tvOS 26.6.* Opening a folder shows the same albums and subfolders as in Photos, and Back returns to the parent. Albums inside folders are not also listed at the top level. Folders that are empty or hold only Shared Albums are hidden.
- [ ] **2.2** For at least 3 albums, compare the card count with Photos on iPhone or Mac: the card should equal *items − videos*. Note any mismatch: ______
- [ ] **2.3** Album covers load, including for albums you haven't opened on the Apple TV.
- [ ] **2.4** Turn on **Diagnostics Overlay** in an album's **Troubleshooting** screen. The Albums header shows "eligible albums: N"; confirm N matches the albums that have photos.

## 3. Is iCloud loading real? (the key feasibility check)

- [ ] **3.1** Open the large album › **Troubleshooting** › **Test iCloud Loading**. Record the summary line: ______
- [ ] **3.2** At least some rows say **"iCloud only"** or **"not local"**, which shows that photos not on the device are being tested. If every row says "on device," pick an older, rarely viewed album and repeat.
- [ ] **3.3** The cloud-only rows show **✓** with a time. Record the median and slowest times: ______
- [ ] **3.4** Run the probe a second time. Previously downloaded rows may now say "on device" (a system cache). This is expected and purgeable; the app doesn't rely on it.

> If 3.3 fails (downloads error or never finish) with a working network, that is a platform-level finding. Record the error text and the Console log lines; do not treat the app as working.

## 4. Order

- [ ] **4.1** With Order = **Album Order** and Shuffle off, play the album with the counter on. Compare the first 10 and last 5 photos with the album's order in Photos on iPhone or Mac. Match? ______
- [ ] **4.2** If they don't match, note the order actually used (date? added order?) and try **Oldest First**. Record which option matches Photos: ______

## 5. Full sequential cycle (large album)

Settings: Shuffle off, Loop on, 3‑second slides (to save time), counter on, diagnostics on.

- [ ] **5.1** Start playback. "Photo 1 of N" shows the **full album count N** (the same as the album card), not a small number.
- [ ] **5.2** Watch the counter go past photo 11, 20, 50, and 100 without jumping back to 1. *(The failure seen in the built-in Photos slideshow.)*
- [ ] **5.3** When a photo isn't ready, the previous photo stays up with "Loading next photo…" or "Downloading from iCloud N%", then advances. The next slide lasts the full duration after it appears.
- [ ] **5.4** Diagnostics while playing: **Buffered ≤ 7**, **Memory ≤ budget**, **loading ≤ 2**. Note the peak memory: ______
- [ ] **5.5** Let it reach photo N and wrap to **Photo 1 of N, cycle 2**. If anything was skipped, a summary notice appears at the wrap.
- [ ] **5.6** Diagnostics at the wrap, or the Console "Cycle 1 complete" line: **Displayed = N** (or N minus the skipped and removed photos, each listed). Record: ______
- [ ] **5.7** Time for the full cycle, and how many times it stopped to load: ______

## 6. Full shuffle cycle

Settings: Shuffle on, Loop on, 3‑second slides.

- [ ] **6.1** Play one full cycle (N slides). The counter shows 1…N once.
- [ ] **6.2** No photo appears twice before the counter wraps. Spot-check by photographing the TV, or enable Action › Include Debug Messages in Console and look for a repeated `Request <token> attempt 1` line within the cycle.
- [ ] **6.3** At the wrap, the first photo of cycle 2 is not the same as the last photo of cycle 1.
- [ ] **6.4** Press Left several times mid-cycle: it retraces exactly the photos just shown, in reverse. Press Right to return.

## 7. Remote controls

- [ ] **7.1** Right / Left click and swipe → next / previous, and the counter updates immediately.
- [ ] **7.2** Press Right three times quickly while the next photo is loading: the counter moves 3 ahead, the current photo stays, and then the target photo appears. It never jumps back.
- [ ] **7.3** Play/Pause pauses: a "Paused" badge appears, nothing advances for 60 s, and prefetch continues (diagnostics Buffered rises). Play/Pause again resumes with the remaining time.
- [ ] **7.4** Click → controls appear with visible focus. Left/right move focus between buttons. Back hides them; Back again exits.
- [ ] **7.5** The Loop and Counter buttons in the controls take effect immediately.
- [ ] **7.6** With Black Bars or Blurred Background, photos of every shape (portrait, landscape, panorama) show whole, with nothing cropped.
- [x] **7.7** Album screen, never-played album: focus starts on **Play Slideshow**. Move Right into the settings, down to any row, then press Left: focus returns to Play. From a settings row, press Play/Pause: the slideshow starts at Photo 1.
- [x] **7.8** Album screen, album left part way through: focus starts on **Resume from Photo N**, with the progress bar under it and a smaller **Start Over** below. Play/Pause from a settings row resumes at Photo N; Start Over starts at Photo 1.

## 8. Network loss and recovery

- [ ] **8.1** During playback, disconnect the Apple TV from the network (unplug Ethernet, or turn off the Wi‑Fi router). Already-buffered photos keep playing (up to about 3).
- [ ] **8.2** At the first photo that isn't buffered: "Waiting for network…" or "retrying…" appears, and the current photo stays on screen. After about 25 s of retries a **"Couldn't Load Photo X of N"** panel appears with Retry / Skip Photo / Exit. There's no endless spinner and no jump to photo 1.
- [ ] **8.3** Record X: ______. Reconnect the network. Within a few seconds the photo loads **without pressing anything** and playback continues from X.
- [ ] **8.4** Repeat, and this time press **Skip Photo** during the outage. At the end of the cycle the summary lists it as skipped.
- [ ] **8.5** Disconnect before starting a slideshow on an album with nothing cached: you get a clear error panel, not a spinner or a loop.

## 9. Leaving and reopening playback

- [ ] **9.1** Press Back mid-slideshow → the album screen. Console shows no further "Request" lines for that session (requests are cancelled).
- [ ] **9.2** Start a *different* album right away. It starts at Photo 1 of its own count, and no photo from the previous album appears.
- [ ] **9.3** Press the TV/Home button mid-slideshow, wait 1 minute, and reopen Stillroom. The slideshow is at the same position and resumes if it was playing.
- [ ] **9.4** Screen saver: while playing, the screen saver never starts (leave it playing past your screen-saver delay). Pause, and the screen saver starts after the normal delay. Exit the slideshow, and normal behaviour continues.
- [ ] **9.5** Run the album for 30+ minutes with diagnostics on. Memory stays within budget, and the app isn't terminated.

## 10. Album edits during playback

- [ ] **10.1** While an album is playing, add two photos to it on your iPhone. When iCloud syncs, the notice "Album gained 2 photos — updates apply after this cycle" appears, and the counter's N does **not** change mid-cycle.
- [ ] **10.2** After the wrap, N increases by 2 ("Album updated" notice).
- [ ] **10.3** Delete a photo that hasn't been shown yet in this cycle. When it's reached, it's skipped automatically and reported as "no longer in library" at the end of the cycle.

## 11. Storage

- [ ] **11.1** Check Apple TV free storage after the tests and compare it with 0.2. Any growth should be system cache, which tvOS can purge; the app keeps no copies. Record: ______

## 12. Vertical photos

Use an album with many vertical photos. Turn on the diagnostics overlay. For each style, watch at least 20 slides.

*2026‑09‑28, Apple TV HD, tvOS 26.6: all five styles played with no playback or memory problems (owner report). The framing checks below are still open.*

- [ ] **12.1** On a fresh install, Vertical Photos starts on **Slow Pan** (the default on every model), and no style is marked as recommended.
- [ ] **12.2** **Blurred Background:** the side bars show a soft, darkened version of the photo; slide changes crossfade without a black flash.
- [ ] **12.3** **Slow Pan:** vertical photos fill the screen and move smoothly (no stutter); portraits end with the face in view. Play/Pause freezes the pan. Note memory versus budget and whether it ever stops to load: ______
- [ ] **12.4** **Smart Crop:** faces are inside the frame (not cut off at the top). Count bad crops out of 20: ______
- [ ] **12.5** **Side by Side:** adjacent vertical photos appear as pairs with "Photos N–N+1 of M"; Left/Right move by whole slides and return to the same pairs. A pair never contains a landscape photo (if it does, PhotoKit's stored dimensions don't match the displayed orientation; note it).
- [ ] **12.6** **Black Bars:** unchanged from before.
- [ ] **12.7** Which style do you prefer on this Apple TV? ______

## 13. Recently Played across Apple TVs

Needs two Apple TVs signed in to the same Apple Account with iCloud Photos on, both on tvOS 18.2 or later, both running this build. Photos gives albums and photos different identifiers on each device; Stillroom syncs Photos *cloud* identifiers and converts them back, which Apple documents for iCloud Photos items but which hasn't been checked for albums across devices yet.

- [ ] **13.1** On TV A, play an album to about photo 20 and press the TV button (leaving the app sends the resume point). On TV B, open Stillroom within a minute or two: the album appears first in Recently Played with the same "Photo 20 of N" and progress bar. Time until it appeared: ______
- [ ] **13.2** Select it on TV B: it resumes at the same photo. Repeat with Shuffle on: the next photos match what TV A would have shown.
- [ ] **13.3** Remove an album from Recently Played on TV B; within a minute or two it is gone on TV A too, and doesn't come back after relaunching either app.
- [ ] **13.4** TV B's Top Shelf shows the synced albums after Stillroom has been opened on it once.
- [ ] **13.5** If an album doesn't appear on TV B, copy both logs off (see README) and look for "iCloud:" lines, especially "cloud identifiers not in this library".
