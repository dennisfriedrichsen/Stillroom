# Stillroom

A native Apple TV app that plays **complete** slideshows of ordinary iCloud Photos albums, including photos that aren't stored on the Apple TV, using only public PhotoKit APIs.

- Pick an album with the Siri Remote and play every still photo in it, in album order or shuffled.
- Photos load a few at a time from iCloud while you watch. The playback sequence is always the whole album, never "whatever happens to be downloaded."
- A **Recently Played** row on the home screen, like the TV app's Continue Watching: a slideshow you left part way through shows a progress bar and resumes at the same photo (in the same shuffle order). Hold Select on a card to start over or remove it. The same albums appear in the Apple TV **Top Shelf** when Stillroom is in the Home screen's top row, and the list **syncs through iCloud** to other Apple TVs on the same Apple Account (tvOS 18.2 or later), so you can stop in one room and continue in another. *Not yet verified across two Apple TVs; see checklist section 13.*

Stillroom is available on the App Store for Apple TV.

> **Verification:** the playback logic is covered by 52 automated tests, and complete playback of a large album has been confirmed on a physical Apple TV. See [Verification status](#verification-status) for what has and hasn't been checked on a device.

## Privacy

Stillroom has no accounts and no server of its own. Photos are read through Apple's Photos framework (PhotoKit), which downloads them from your iCloud Photos library when they aren't on the Apple TV.

| Data | Where it's kept | Leaves the Apple TV? |
|---|---|---|
| Slideshow photos | In memory only, while on screen or about to be. No slideshow image is written to disk by the app; PhotoKit's own caches are managed by the system | No |
| Top Shelf covers: small JPEGs of the albums in Recently Played | The app group's `Library/Caches`, replaced as the list changes | No |
| Recently Played and resume points: Photos identifiers, position, shuffle seed, and dates, never photos | App preferences, and iCloud key-value storage on tvOS 18.2 or later | Yes, to your own iCloud account, so your other Apple TVs can continue where you stopped |
| Settings and saved album-cover identifiers | App preferences | No |
| Diagnostics log | `Library/Caches/Diagnostics` (purgeable) | No |

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Deployment target | **tvOS 18.0** |
| Built and tested with | Xcode 27.0 (27A266a), tvOS 27.0 SDK, Swift 6.4; simulator-tested on tvOS 26.5 and 27.0 |
| Hardware | Any Apple TV on tvOS 18 or later: Apple TV HD and **every** Apple TV 4K generation |
| On the Apple TV | Signed in to your Apple Account, with **iCloud Photos turned on** (Settings › Users and Accounts › *your account* › iCloud) |

**Why tvOS 18:** PhotoKit's required pieces need only tvOS 14 or earlier. The deployment target is set by the app's own code: the Observation framework (`@Observable`, tvOS 17), `Synchronization.Mutex` (tvOS 18), and current SwiftUI focus and command APIs. tvOS 18 runs on every Apple TV that can run tvOS 17, so raising the target costs no hardware, and it matches the iOS 18 baseline used across these projects.

**Older Apple TVs:** tvOS 27 dropped the Apple TV HD and the **Apple TV 4K (1st generation, model A1842)**, so tvOS 26 is the last version they run. Because the minimum is tvOS 18, Stillroom runs on tvOS 26 with no changes; the deployment target is a minimum, not the version you build with. Building with the tvOS 27 SDK in Xcode 27 still installs on a tvOS 26 device. Don't raise the deployment target above 26 while you use one of these models. To check your model, see Settings › General › About, and compare the model number with Apple's [Identify your Apple TV model](https://support.apple.com/en-us/101605).

## Using Stillroom

- **Albums screen:** albums are arranged in the same folders as in Photos. Folders and albums appear in the same custom order as in Photos (PhotoKit's unsorted order; Apple doesn't document that it matches Photos, but it did on an Apple TV HD with tvOS 26.6 on 2026‑09‑24). A folder card shows how many albums it contains (subfolders included) and opens its own grid. Empty folders, and folders holding only Shared Albums, are hidden. Each album card shows the album name, cover, and number of eligible still photos. Albums appear immediately; counts and covers fill in over a few seconds ("counting photos…"), which took about 9 s for 157 albums on an Apple TV HD. The cover is the album's key photo from Photos. Key photos are slow to look up on older Apple TVs (20–34 s for 157 albums on an Apple TV HD), so the first photo stands in until the key photo arrives in the background; key photos are saved between launches, so after the first run covers are right immediately. The lookup pauses during a slideshow. Live Photos count and are shown as stills; videos are excluded from the count and the slideshow.
- **Album screen:** **Play Slideshow**, or **Resume from Photo N** with a progress bar if you left the album part way through, and a smaller **Start Over** below it. Focus starts on Play/Resume, pressing Left from any setting returns to it, and the remote's Play/Pause button starts or resumes the slideshow from anywhere on the screen. The settings beside it apply to **every album** and are saved between launches: Shuffle, Order, Loop, Slide Duration (default 8 s), the "Photo 12 of 600" counter, Transition, Transition Speed, Ken Burns Effect, and Vertical Photos. **Troubleshooting** at the bottom opens Test iCloud Loading and the diagnostics overlay.
- **Vertical Photos** (how photos that don't fill a 16:9 TV are shown):

| Style | What you see | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Blurred Background** | Whole photo, with a blurred, darkened copy filling the sides | Lowest: one extra 64‑pixel image per photo |
| **Slow Pan** *(default)* | Vertical photos fill the width and slowly pan, ending on the face or subject found by Vision (or the upper third if none is found). The pan pauses with Play/Pause and is turned off by Reduce Motion | Highest: pan images are up to twice as tall as they are wide (~30 MB each at 1080p), so fewer are buffered (2 ahead, 1 behind), plus Vision detection |
| **Smart Crop** | Vertical photos fill the screen, cropped around the face or subject (about two thirds of the height is cut) | Moderate: Vision detection; the stored image is screen-sized |
| **Side by Side** | Two vertical photos that are next to each other in the playback order share a slide ("Photos 127–128 of 600") | Two downloads per slide; buffers 4 photos ahead |
| **Black Bars** | Whole photo, black bars | Lowest |

  Photos narrower than 0.9:1 (width:height) count as vertical. Landscape photos are shown whole in every style (with the blurred background unless Black Bars is chosen). Every style plays smoothly on an Apple TV HD, the slowest supported model, so none is recommended over another; Slow Pan is the default on every Apple TV. **Troubleshooting › Test iCloud Loading** checks 12 photos spread across the album and reports which ones are already on the Apple TV and how long the others take to download.
- **Transitions:** automatic advances use **Crossfade** *(default)* or **Fade Through Black**, at **Quick** (0.6 s), **Gentle** *(default, 1.5 s)*, or **Slow** (3 s). Pressing ◀︎ or ▶︎ on the remote always slides quickly (0.35 s) to the previous or next photo from the side pressed; with Reduce Motion on it crossfades quickly instead. **Ken Burns Effect** *(off by default)* slowly zooms each single photo in or out (alternating, up to 12%) around the face or subject Vision finds, across the photo's whole time on screen including both fades. Slow Pan photos keep panning and Side by Side pairs don't zoom. It pauses with Play/Pause and is turned off by Reduce Motion. With it on, Vision runs on every photo, not just vertical ones in Slow Pan or Smart Crop.
- **During a slideshow (Siri Remote):**

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Right / Left (click or swipe) | Next / Previous |
| Play/Pause | Pause or resume |
| Click, or Up/Down | Show controls (Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Loop, Counter, Exit) |
| Back / Menu | Hide the controls, or exit the slideshow |

- **If a photo can't load:** the current photo stays on screen with a small "Loading…" or "retrying…" note. After automatic retries fail, Stillroom stops and offers **Retry**, **Skip Photo**, or **Exit**. Skipped photos are listed in the summary at the end of the cycle.

## Development

### Build

```bash
git clone <repository-url> ~/src/github/dennisfriedrichsen/Stillroom
cd ~/src/github/dennisfriedrichsen/Stillroom
open Stillroom.xcworkspace
```

Open the **workspace**, not the `.xcodeproj`. The workspace includes the local `StillroomCore` package, so ⌘U runs its tests from the `Stillroom` scheme.

The app has no third-party dependencies.

Command-line equivalents:

```bash
# Playback-logic tests on the Mac (fastest)
cd StillroomCore && swift test
```

```bash
# Same tests on the tvOS Simulator
xcodebuild -workspace Stillroom.xcworkspace -scheme Stillroom -destination 'platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)' test
```

```bash
# Compile for a real Apple TV without signing (checks the device SDK)
xcodebuild -workspace Stillroom.xcworkspace -scheme Stillroom -destination 'generic/platform=tvOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

#### Simulator demo mode (Debug builds only)

The tvOS Simulator has no iCloud Photos library. To check the slideshow screens, pass the launch argument `-demoSlideshow` (Scheme › Run › Arguments). The app then plays 60 generated, numbered images with random delays, and every 7th image fails on purpose so you can see the retry and stall states. This mode is compiled out of Release builds and never touches PhotoKit.

To check the album screen, pass `-demoAlbumScreen` for an album that hasn't been played, or `-demoAlbumScreen -demoResume` for one left at photo 128 of 392. Play shows a placeholder instead of a slideshow, and the demo uses its own Recently Played list, so your real one isn't changed.

#### App icon

The app uses the selected Stillroom icon: two interwoven frames with a saturated violet-to-cyan gradient. The approved source is `design/app-icon-options/stillroom-b-vibrant.png`. Regenerate the Home screen (400×240 and 800×480) and App Store (1280×768) assets from the repository root with `swift scripts/export-app-icon.swift`. The static Top Shelf images (shown when nothing has been played yet) come from the same source; regenerate them with `swift scripts/export-top-shelf.swift`.

The artwork is flattened into the back layer with a transparent front layer to preserve the approved design; it does not have separate foreground parallax. The app name and Top Shelf artwork remain unchanged.

### Run a development build on your Apple TV

#### 1. Choose how to sign

You do **not** need a paid membership to run Stillroom on your own Apple TV.

| | Free Apple Account ("Personal Team") | Apple Developer Program ($99/year) |
|---|---|---|
| Run on your own Apple TV from Xcode | Yes | Yes |
| How long an install keeps working | **7 days.** The provisioning profile expires; after that the app won't launch until you build and run again from Xcode. | 1 year (development profile) |
| Limits | Up to 3 devices and 10 App IDs, both expiring after 7 days; up to 3 of your apps per device | 100 devices of each type per year |
| TestFlight / App Store | No | Yes |
| Capabilities this app needs | Photos permission (no entitlement) an **App Group** (`group.com.friedrichsenweb.Stillroom`) shared with the Top Shelf extension, and **iCloud key-value storage** for syncing Recently Played between Apple TVs. Automatic signing creates the group; if you change the bundle identifier, change the group in `Config/*.entitlements` and `StillroomShared/TopShelfFeed.swift` to match | Same |

Limits are from Apple's [membership comparison](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/) page, checked 2026‑09‑22. With a free account, plan to reinstall from Xcode about once a week. The paid program mainly buys a 1‑year install and TestFlight, which lets the Apple TV install updates itself.

#### 2. Set up signing in Xcode

1. Xcode › Settings › Accounts › **+** › Apple Account, and sign in. A free account appears as "*Your Name* (Personal Team)."
2. In the project navigator select **Stillroom** › target **Stillroom** › **Signing & Capabilities**.
3. Keep **Automatically manage signing** on, and choose your team.
4. If Xcode says the bundle identifier `com.friedrichsenweb.Stillroom` is unavailable, change it to something unique, such as `com.<yourname>.Stillroom`.

#### 3. Pair the Apple TV with Xcode (one time)

Apple TV 4K has no USB port, so pairing happens over the network. tvOS has **no Developer Mode switch**; pairing alone enables development.

1. Put the Mac and the Apple TV on the same network.
2. On the Apple TV, open **Settings › Remotes and Devices › Remote App and Devices**, and stay on that screen.
3. In Xcode, open **Window › Devices and Simulators** (called *Device Hub* in newer Xcode versions). Your Apple TV appears under Discovered; select it and click **Pair**.
4. Enter the code shown on the TV. Xcode may take a few minutes to prepare the device for development the first time.

#### 4. Run

1. In the Xcode toolbar choose the **Stillroom** scheme and your Apple TV as the destination.
2. Press ⌘R. The first install to a new device can take a while.
3. On first launch Stillroom explains why it needs Photos access. Choose **Continue**, then choose **Allow access to all Photos**. The tvOS 26 prompt also offers a **Select** (limited access) option; with that, Stillroom sees only the photos you picked, so albums would look incomplete.
4. After that, Stillroom appears on the Home screen and you can launch it without Xcode, until the profile expires (7 days with a free account).

**Troubleshooting**
- *"Untrusted developer" or the app won't open:* rebuild and run from Xcode; free-account profiles expire after 7 days.
- *Apple TV not listed in Xcode:* stay on the Remote App and Devices screen, check both are on the same network and subnet, and try toggling Wi‑Fi on the Mac.
- *No albums:* confirm iCloud Photos is on for the current Apple TV user, and give a new sign-in time to sync.

### The key rule: the sequence and the buffer are independent

- **`PlaybackSequence`** is a snapshot of *every* eligible asset identifier, taken when playback starts. A 600‑photo album is a 600‑item sequence, whether five images are loaded or none. Position (`cycle`, `position`) only changes through `advance()` and `retreat()`. It knows nothing about downloads.
- **`ImageBuffer`** only holds a small window: the photo playback needs, the one on screen, 3 upcoming, and 2 previous. It never decides what plays next. It just reports when each image is ready or has failed.
- **`SlideshowController`** connects the two through one explicit phase:

```
            start
  idle ───────────► loading ──(target image ready)──► showing
                     ▲   │                               │
     next/prev/timer │   │ retries exhausted             │ timer (only runs while showing & not paused)
                     │   ▼                               │
                     └ stalled ◄─────────────────────────┘
                   (Retry / Skip)
  showing ──(end of cycle, loop off)──► finished     any ──(nothing could load)──► failed
```

Every input (slide timer, image completion, remote press, network change) arrives on the main actor and goes through this one state machine, so there are no competing timers or callbacks. The slide timer starts only when the target image is actually on screen, and pause simply cancels it and remembers the time left.

The controller owns two small helpers, neither of which decides anything about playback on its own: **`SlideTimer`** holds the countdown as one state (idle, running, or paused with the time left), and **`CycleTracker`** records which photos were shown, skipped, or found removed this cycle, keeps skipped and removed photos off their slides, and builds the cycle report. Every transition stays in `SlideshowController`.

### Loading and memory

- **Requests:** `deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat`, `isNetworkAccessAllowed = true`, `targetSize` = the TV's native pixel size (e.g. 3840×2160), `contentMode = .aspectFit`. Original camera files are never requested.
- **Decoding:** each result is drawn off the main thread into an opaque 8‑bit bitmap that fits the screen. That decodes it before display, applies orientation, and caps it at ~33 MB on a 4K TV.
- **Bounds:** at most 2 concurrent requests. The look-ahead is 6 photos (about 48 s of slides at 8 s each), 3 in Slow Pan (larger images) and 8 in Side by Side (about 4 pairs), plus 2 previous (1 in Slow Pan). The decoded-memory budget is exactly that window at its largest image size: ~83 MB at 1080p and ~330 MB at 4K for the normal styles; up to ~180 MB at 1080p for Slow Pan. New prefetches aren't started if they could exceed it; the image playback is waiting for always loads. The needed image can pre-empt a prefetch for a request slot.
- **Failures found early:** a photo that fails while being prefetched doesn't interrupt the current slide. When playback reaches it, it gets a fresh round of retries before the Retry/Skip panel appears.
- **Eviction and cancellation:** anything outside the window is evicted and its request cancelled on every move, on album change, and when leaving playback. Backgrounding cancels prefetches; a memory warning drops everything except the current and on-screen images and shrinks the window.
- **No slideshow persistence:** the app writes no slideshow image data to disk; the only images it writes are the small Top Shelf covers (see [Privacy](#privacy)). PhotoKit's own caches are system-managed and purgeable; the app never assumes they hold anything, and it doesn't use preheating (`PHCachingImageManager`) as a signal that anything has downloaded.

### Threading rule: no blocking work on Swift's cooperative pool

Swift concurrency runs `async` code on a thread pool with one thread per CPU core — **two on an Apple TV HD**. On 2026‑09‑24 a slideshow froze on an Apple TV HD because two Vision subject-detection calls (Smart Crop) hung and occupied both threads; timers and the download watchdog, which woke up through that pool, never fired again. The rules since then:

- Synchronous PhotoKit fetches, image decoding/drawing, and Vision run on dedicated dispatch queues (`BlockingWork`, `SlideRenderer`), never directly in `async` code.
- Vision gets 3 seconds per photo. If it doesn't answer, that photo uses the fallback framing, detection is switched off for the rest of the session, and the event is logged.
- Slide timers and the stall watchdog use the main dispatch queue (`ContinuousScheduler`), not `Task.sleep`, so they keep working even if the pool is starved. `SchedulerTests` blocks every pool thread and checks that a timer still fires on time; the old `Task.sleep` version fails it.

### PhotoKit callback handling (`PhotoKitRequest`)

- Degraded previews are ignored; only the final result completes a load.
- The continuation resumes exactly once (guarded by a `Mutex`), whether the callback arrives synchronously, asynchronously, more than once, or never (after cancellation).
- Task cancellation calls `cancelImageRequest`, including when cancellation lands before PhotoKit has returned the request ID.
- Every load attempt carries a unique token. Results for a token that is no longer current — after navigation, a watchdog timeout, a new album, or leaving playback — are counted as stale and dropped. Each session also gets a fresh buffer, so another session's callback can't affect it.

### Failure handling

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Download error or network error | Retried automatically after 2 s, 6 s, then 15 s (4 attempts). The current photo stays on screen, with a "retrying…" note. |
| No download progress for 30 s, or one attempt over 120 s | Treated as stalled: cancelled and retried. No infinite silent waiting. |
| Retries exhausted | The slideshow holds on the current photo and offers **Retry**, **Skip Photo**, or **Exit**. Nothing advances on its own. |
| User skips | Recorded, and listed in the end-of-cycle report ("Displayed 598 of 600 · 2 skipped (couldn't load)"). |
| Network lost, then restored | Position is kept. When the path returns, every failed image, including the stalled one, is retried automatically. |
| Photo deleted after the snapshot | PhotoKit can't find it, so it is skipped without retrying and reported as "no longer in library." |
| Album edited during playback | The running cycle is never rebuilt. A notice says the changes apply after this cycle, and the fresh snapshot is used from the next cycle. |
| Every photo in a cycle skipped or missing | Playback stops with an explanation instead of looping. |
| A load fails | Never resets to the first photo and never triggers an early loop. Position only moves through the sequence. |

### Vertical photos and slides

- **Slides:** `PlaybackSequence` plays *slides*. In Side by Side mode, adjacent vertical photos (from PhotoKit's stored dimensions, available without downloading) are paired greedily per cycle, so Previous always returns the same pairs. Shuffle permutes photos first, then pairs; every photo still appears exactly once per cycle. A pair is shown only when both photos are ready. If one fails after retries, the slideshow stalls; **Skip Photo** records that photo as skipped and shows the other one alone.
- **Rendering:** `SlideRenderer` prepares each photo for the chosen style off the main thread: fit to screen, render at screen width for panning (max 2560 px wide), or crop to the screen's shape around the detected subject. Subject detection uses Vision face rectangles, falling back to attention-based saliency, on a 512‑pixel copy. The blurred background is a 64‑pixel Core Image blur.
- **Transitions:** slides on screen are layers in `SlideshowView`. Crossfade fades the next slide in over the current one, which stays fully visible underneath until the fade completes, so slides never flash black. Fade Through Black fades the old layers out, then the new one in. A remote press records the slide it moved to (cycle and position), and only that slide pushes in from the side, so a press that didn't move (Previous on the first photo) never affects a later slide. Old layers are dropped only when the newest slide is fully in, so a transition can be interrupted by the next one at any point. Each slide's Ken Burns zoom keeps its own clock (stopped while paused), so the outgoing slide keeps moving while it fades out.
- **Simulator note:** Vision's saliency request fails in the simulator ("Failed to create espresso context"), so there panning and cropping fall back to the upper-third framing. Detection must be checked on the Apple TV.

### Ordering

- **Album Order (default):** `PHAsset.fetchAssets(in: album, options: nil)` with no sort descriptors and no predicate; videos are filtered out afterwards so the order isn't disturbed. In practice PhotoKit returns a user album's own order, but **Apple does not document that guarantee**, so check it on your Apple TV (checklist step 4).
- **Documented fallback:** if album order doesn't match what you expect, choose **Oldest First** (capture date ascending) or **Newest First** under Order.
- **Shuffle:** a new permutation each cycle; no photo repeats within a cycle; Previous walks back through that cycle's history; the first photo of a cycle is never the same as the last photo of the previous cycle (albums of 2 or more).

### Keeping the TV awake

`isIdleTimerDisabled` is on only while a slideshow is loading or showing, not paused, and in the foreground. It's turned off when you pause, stall, finish, exit, or background the app, so the normal screen saver and sleep behaviour returns.

### Diagnostics and privacy

- **Diagnostics overlay** (turn on in an album's **Troubleshooting**; it applies everywhere): session, cycle, position, eligible album count, displayed / buffered / loading / pending / failed / skipped / removed counts, decoded memory versus budget, retries, stale callbacks, network state, and the last few requests with attempt number, duration, and outcome.
- **Logging:** `os.Logger`, subsystem `com.friedrichsenweb.Stillroom`, categories `library`, `loading`, and `playback`. Asset identifiers are logged only as short one-way hashes; image contents are never logged. Logs never leave the device. To stream logs from a paired Apple TV, use Console.app and filter on that subsystem.
- **On-device log file:** the same info-level messages (launch with app version, model and tvOS version; each request, load time and failure; each wait, display, stall, pause and navigation) are also written to `Library/Caches/Diagnostics/stillroom.log` in the app's container. It rotates at 400 KB (one previous file is kept), lives in purgeable Caches, and is never uploaded. After a problem, copy it off the paired Apple TV without restarting the app:

```bash
xcrun devicectl device copy from --device "Living Room (3)" --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier com.friedrichsenweb.Stillroom --source Library/Caches/Diagnostics/stillroom.log --destination ./stillroom.log
```

- **Loading indicator:** after 10 seconds of waiting, the "Loading…" or "retrying…" text also shows the elapsed time and the attempt number (for example "15 s · attempt 3 of 4"), so a slow download is distinguishable from a stuck one.

## Tests

`StillroomCore/Tests` — 57 tests in 9 suites (Swift Testing) with a `FakeImageProvider` whose requests stay pending until the test completes, fails, or cancels them, and a `ManualScheduler` that makes time deterministic.

| Requirement | Tests |
|---|---|
| Album larger than the buffer plays completely before repeating | `largeAlbumPlaysCompletely` (40 photos, buffer of 6), `sequentialFullCycle` (600) |
| Delayed downloads don't reset or truncate; timer starts on display | `delayedDownloadHolds` |
| Out-of-order completion doesn't reorder playback | `outOfOrderCompletion` |
| Shuffle doesn't repeat within a cycle, no boundary repeat, history | `shuffleIsPermutation` (5 seeds × 3 cycles), `shuffleBoundary` (300 seeds), `shuffleHistory`, `upcomingAcrossBoundary`, `shuffleCycle` |
| Pause, and navigation during loading | `pauseKeepsPrefetching`, `navigationDuringLoading`, `navigationWhilePaused` |
| Failures, retries, explicit skips | `retriesThenStall`, `explicitSkipReported`, `deletedAssetSkipped`, `nothingLoads`, `stallWatchdog`, `retryExhaustion`, `prefetchFailureRetriedOnArrival`, `loadingElapsedAndAttempt` |
| Network recovery | `networkRecovery` |
| Stale callbacks | `staleCallbackFromPreviousSession` (including a photo shared by both albums), `staleCallbackAfterNavigation`, `staleAfterReset` |
| Buffer bounds | `concurrencyBounded`, `byteBudget`, `neededPreemptsPrefetch`, `eviction`, `memoryPressure` |
| Lifecycle, album edits, loop off | `backgroundLifecycle`, `stopCancels`, `albumEditDeferred`, `finishesWithoutLoop`, `endsWithoutLoop`, `upcomingBounded` |
| Timers under thread-pool starvation | `timersSurvivePoolStarvation`, `cancellation` |
| Slide timer pause, resume, and cancel | `pauseAndResume`, `startWhileRunning`, `cancelForgetsPause` |
| Per-cycle skip / remove / show bookkeeping | `skipAndRemove`, `readmitThenShow` |
| Resume where a slideshow stopped, including shuffle order and pairs | `resumeAtPhoto`, `resumeShuffleSeed`, `seekResumes`, `seekIntoPair` |
| Recently Played merging between Apple TVs | `newestWins`, `removals`, `limitsAndPruning` |
| Side-by-side pairs and pan timing | `greedyPairs`, `stableBackNavigation`, `pairedShuffleIsPermutation`, `windowsAroundPair`, `pairWaitsForBoth`, `skipHalfOfPair`, `slideElapsed` |

The PhotoKit layer (`PhotoKitRequest`, `PhotoKitImageProvider`, `PhotoLibraryModel`, `AlbumFetcher`) has no automated tests: the simulator has no iCloud library to test it against. It is covered by the device checklist.

## Limitations (version 1)

- Still photos only. Live Photos are shown as stills; videos are excluded. No music or video; transitions are a 0.6 s crossfade (plus the optional slow pan).
- Smart Crop and Slow Pan intentionally don't show every part of a vertical photo at once (Smart Crop never shows the cropped parts). Choose Blurred Background, Side by Side, or Black Bars to always see whole photos.
- Ordinary user albums only; Shared Albums and smart albums (such as Favorites) are not listed.
- Album order relies on PhotoKit's undocumented default order for user albums, with date-based orders as the fallback.
- If a photo can only be downloaded very slowly, the slideshow waits for it (with a visible indicator) rather than skipping ahead; the stall watchdog bounds that wait.
- With a free Apple Account the install stops working after 7 days until you run it from Xcode again.
- PhotoKit behaviour on a multi-user Apple TV follows the current user's iCloud Photos library.

## Appendix: prelaunch feasibility (historical)

*Written before Stillroom was built, to check that the design was possible with public APIs. Kept for reference; for what has since been confirmed on a real Apple TV, see [Verification status](#verification-status).*

Sources checked on 2026‑09‑22: the tvOS 27.0 SDK headers in Xcode 27.0 (`Photos.framework`), and Apple's documentation for PhotoKit, `PHImageManager`, `PHImageRequestOptions.isNetworkAccessAllowed`, `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for:handler:)`, and `PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(with:subtype:options:)`.

| Capability | API | tvOS availability | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Framework | PhotoKit (`Photos`) | tvOS 10+ | Apple describes it as giving access to photos "on the person's device and in iCloud." |
| Authorization | `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite)` | tvOS 14+ | Needs `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`. No entitlement or paid capability required. |
| Album enumeration | `PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(with: .album, subtype: .albumRegular, …)` | tvOS 10+ | Ordinary user albums. Shared Albums are a separate subtype (`.albumCloudShared`) and are excluded. |
| Asset enumeration | `PHAsset.fetchAssets(in:options:)` | tvOS 10+ | |
| iCloud download | `PHImageManager.requestImage` with `isNetworkAccessAllowed = true`, `progressHandler` | tvOS 10+ | Documented: "If true, and the requested image is not stored on the local device, Photos downloads the image from iCloud." |
| Degraded vs. final results | `PHImageResultIsDegradedKey`, `PHImageResultIsInCloudKey`, `PHImageCancelledKey`, `PHImageErrorKey` | tvOS 10+ | |
| Availability | `PHPhotoLibrary.unavailabilityReason`, availability observer | tvOS 13+ | |
| Change notifications | `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver` | tvOS 10+ | |
| Not on tvOS | Limited-library picker, upload-job APIs | — | Irrelevant here. `PHAuthorizationStatus.limited` is handled, but tvOS has no picker to change the selection. |

**Conclusion:** there is no documented platform limitation that prevents this design. All required APIs are public and marked available on tvOS. Private APIs, Apple Account credentials, and scraping are not used.

At the time, the checks that needed a real Apple TV (album listing, downloading photos that aren't on the device, album order, download times, and the Settings paths in the app's messages) were listed here; their results are now tracked in [Verification status](#verification-status) and the [device checklist](docs/DEVICE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md).

On the built-in slideshow looping over its first ~10 photos: that behaviour is consistent with a player that treats the locally cached subset as the whole album, but it is **not confirmed**. Stillroom is designed so that failure mode can't happen, whatever the cause.
